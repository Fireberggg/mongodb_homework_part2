# mongo-homework (part2)
This is mongodb & mongoose homework (part 2). Thanks for reading this. In this homework i've implemented all required methods for my api endpoints. The copy of my database (which i used) can be found in dbSource folder in my project (there are 2 versions of it: 1 - plain db export, 2 - db converted in JSON file, so can be easily imported and used in bson format). Also used MVC code stucture. The /articles (GET) method fetch with filtering is working with query params. I would highly appreciate any criticism and if there are some mistakes or bad outputs which i didn't spot i'll try to fix it, if you tell me about them.
